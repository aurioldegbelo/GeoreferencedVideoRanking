## Configuration

The application needs to be configured to your local environment in order to work. It needs the connection information of the video database which serves the desired data. Moreover, the file directory holding the videos needs to be configured so that they can be viewed in the application. The associated parameters can be found within the head section of the *app.js* file. Set the value of 
the variable *dbConnectionString* to the connection string of your database. Then, set *fovTableName* to the name of the table holding the FOV information. Finally, set *video_directory* to the location under which the videos referenced by the database can be found.
